# Intro to Pomodoro-dashboard
Pomodoro-Dashboard is a timer app which implements the Pomodoro study technique which involves 25 minutes of intense study time followed by 5 minutes of rest time. 
Every 4th rest cycle, there's 15 minutes of rest time instead of 5. 
## Features
The app disposes of the hassle to set up timer with rest and study times by automatically alternating between study, short rest, and long rest times. 
Additionally, the timer background reflects the weather of the user's current location to allow for convenient planning for after studying.
